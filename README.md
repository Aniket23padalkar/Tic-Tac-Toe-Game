## Description

I built this project with clean, well-structured code. While building it, I learned about **array destructuring**, working with **2D arrays**, and implemented a neat visual effect: a line appears through the winning combination when a player wins.

## Tech Stack

-   **HTML**
-   **CSS**
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## Features

-   Clicking a box alternates between **X** and **O**.
-   The game always starts with **Player X**'s turn.
-   Once a player wins, further clicks are disabled.
-   A display shows whose turn it is.
-   A message displays the winner.
-   A line appears through the winning combination.
-   A **Restart** button resets the game.

## Final Thoughts

This project was fun and challenging to build. The most interesting part was designing the logic to check for winners by creating all winning combinations (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and using **array destructuring** to match and highlight the winning pattern.
